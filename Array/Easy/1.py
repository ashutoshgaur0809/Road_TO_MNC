To solve this problem, let's break down the rules and mechanics of the game:

Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from the pile.
Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones.
For each subsequent turn, each player removes 1 fewer stones than the opponent's previous move.
The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
Key observations:
Alice starts by removing 10 stones, and each subsequent player removes 1 fewer stone than the previous player's move.
Alice wins if she can make the last valid move. The game essentially revolves around the number of stones remaining and whether a player can make a valid move.
The game progresses in a way where the number of stones removed on each turn decreases by 1. Alice starts with removing 10 stones, Bob removes 9 stones, Alice removes 8, and so on.
Strategy to Determine the Winner:
Initial Move by Alice: Alice removes 10 stones on her first turn.
Subsequent Moves: The number of stones removed decreases with each player's turn.
End Condition: The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move because the number of stones left is fewer than the required stones to remove.
Plan:
Simulate the game: Track the number of stones and simulate the players' moves.
Determine who cannot make a move: If the number of stones left is less than the required number to remove, the player whose turn it is loses.
Approach:
Start with n stones.
Alice's first move is to remove 10 stones. If n is less than 10, Alice loses immediately.
After Alice's first move, the game alternates with Bob and Alice removing progressively fewer stones. The number of stones they must remove starts at 10 and decreases by 1 each turn.
If at any point, the number of stones left is less than the number of stones required to remove, the player whose turn it is loses.
Algorithm:
Start by checking if Alice can make her first move (removing 10 stones).
Continue alternating turns and reducing the number of stones removed by 1.
Check if the player whose turn it is can make a valid move. If not, they lose.
Here's the implementation of this approach:

python
Copy code
def stoneGameVIII(n: int) -> bool:
    # Start with Alice's turn, i.e., initially she has to remove 10 stones.
    current_stones = n
    turn = 10  # Alice starts by removing 10 stones
    
    while current_stones >= turn:
        # Update the number of stones remaining after this turn
        current_stones -= turn
        # Prepare for the next turn, which will remove 1 fewer stone
        turn -= 1
    
    # If current_stones is still >= the next required turn, Alice will win.
    return current_stones % 2 == 0
